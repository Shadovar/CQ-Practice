# Let the training begin!

Here's the breakdown:

Choose a subsection of problems to work on. They will be divided into 5 sections: Easiest, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Hardest. They are sorted into these groups as evenly as possible, but if you find that an Easy problem is a bit harder than a Medium problem for you, deal with it, solve it anyways :)

For each coding "session" in which you partake, set a goal from one of these four categories: Syntax, Algo, Speed, Efficiency

Syntax: improve syntax fluency in either language. For instance, if you just learned the Java array syntax, you would create a few test programs using arrays and their functions. Problems in the Easiest to Medium category would be most suitable to train this skill.

Algo: improve knowledge of algorithms and programming concepts in areas which you are not familiar. For example, if you are not very sure how the HashMap data structure works, or are just learning about shortest path algorithms, you would find problems relating to these concepts/algos and work on them. Problems in Medium to Hardest are generally good for learning new types of algorithms and concepts.

Speed: improve how much time it takes for you to solve a problem or series of problems. Any difficulty/mixed difficulties can work to train this. This can be measured in either way: number of correct solutions in a given amount of time (e.g. 1 hour), or time taken for a given set of problems.

Efficiency: improve the effeciency of your code. This is not a primary focus for any of us right now, as for the competition our main priorities are to get as many problems correct as possible as quickly as possible, in whatever means gets the correct solution first (yes Carl, you have a green light to bruteforce things). However, if you are interested in a way to do something more efficiently, more optimized for whatever, you can train this skill.


Once you have chosen your goal and the problems you will solve for that session, create a folder inside your own folder named as the current date in MM_DD_YYYY format. Inside each of these subfolders, you should have a file named 'log' (template for this file is included in each of your folders) where you specify what skill you are training from the aforementioned (and what particularly of that skill you are training, if the skill is Syntax or Algo), Java or Python, which problem(s) you are attempting, and how long it took you to do each of them (see timing instructions below). When you have completed the session, commit your solutions to that folder along with the log file. 

Note that once you have solved a problem the first time, you may solve it a second time in another session if you like - you can train multiple skills with the same problems, and there certainly is more than one solution to each of them. Once you understand the syntax and algos required for a certain type of problem, however, train your speed by solving as many different problems that you've never seen before as you can.

Timing instructions:

Set up a timer which you can easily start and stop/pause when you are coding. If you can get someone else to do this for you, even better.

If you are training any skill besides speed:
  - Time each problem separately, and in the log file, record the time taken next to each problem completed correctly.
If you are training speed:
  - Choose if you wish to time yourself doing a given number of problems, or if you wish to complete as many problems as you can in a given amount of time.
  - If you wish to do a given number of problems, record the time taken to complete the entire session at the end of the log file.
  - If you wish to do as many problems as you can, specify the time you allotted for that session as well as the number of problems correctly completed during the session at the end of the log file.
  

A note about there being the option of both Java and Python - I recommend you stick with one language mainly that you are most comfortable with and learn it well, and in maybe one or two Syntax sessions, try the other language in case you find that some types of problems you can solve more easily with that language.


That's about all I can think of for now.

Good luck and Godspeed Team Python!
